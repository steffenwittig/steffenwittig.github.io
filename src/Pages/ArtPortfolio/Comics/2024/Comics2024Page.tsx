      <h2>NotSteffenWittig Comics of 2024</h2>
      <p>
        In 2024, my productivity surged once more after a period of reduced comic output in 2022. This resurgence was
        largely due to upgrading my equipment to better facilitate spontaneous drawing sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For over a decade, I relied on various drawing screens tethered to a stationary PC for my digital artwork, which
        confined me to my desk â€” a setup I grew increasingly weary of in recent years. However, in 2024, I made a
        significant transition to an iPad Pro (following a brief experiment with a Samsung S6 Lite).
